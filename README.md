# Heart Disease Predictor Project

This project aims to develop a comprehensive data pipeline to predict heart disease using machine learning techniques.
The goal is to collect, process, and analyze heart disease data to build a predictive model that can provide actionable insights for healthcare providers.
This project is driven by the need to support early identification of individuals at risk, enabling timely interventions and improving patient outcomes.
Early detection is crucial as it can significantly reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with heart disease, which remains a leading cause of death worldwide.
The predictive model developed in this project will analyze medical history and clinical data to identify patterns and correlations that are indicative of heart disease.
This will assist healthcare professionals in making informed decisions about patient care, ultimately improving the preventive approach to heart disease and reducing healthcare costs.
The project involves multiple stages including data collection from the UCI Heart Disease dataset, data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection and training, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation.
The successful implementation of this model could revolutionize the preventive approach to heart disease by providing a reliable method for early detection.
